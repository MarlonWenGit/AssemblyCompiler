The easiest way to use the compiler is to copy and paste the kotlin code in AssemblyCompiler.kt into KOTLIN PLAYGROUND (search it up).
Copy and paste your ASSEMBLY program into the "val program variables", which is a list of function, and remember to add commas at the end of each line.
Really should not take more than 5-10 minutes.

// ONLY 2 MODIFICATIONS YOU SHOULD MAKE TO THIS PROGRAM
// The "val program", where you write your program (its in the middle of the file somewhere)
// The "val tests" which is how many randomized tests to run (its in the bottom of the file somewhere)

// The test cases are 2 randomly generated 16 bit numbers
